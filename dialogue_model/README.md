## Conversation Model

Our conversation model is trained on synthesized data between a generic persona and a persona that represents an ESL (English as a second language) speaker. We include our training data for this model, as well as the training script for this model, in this directory.

Our model is also hosted on Huggingface [here](). You can refer to the `nce_v7_llama.py` filie in the `eden_api` directory for how to use the conversation model.
