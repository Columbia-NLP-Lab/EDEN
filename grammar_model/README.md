# Spoken Grammar Correction Model

This directory contains an example python script for using our spoken grammar correction model. The script is not directly runnable, but it provides an illustration of what prompts to use with the grammar model. 

Please see the spoken grammar correction model [here](https://huggingface.co/sylviali/llama-2-gpt4-grammar).

See the training script for the grammar model in [our previous repository](https://github.com/siyan-sylvia-li/adaptive_empathetic_BEA2024/tree/main/grammar_model_training).
